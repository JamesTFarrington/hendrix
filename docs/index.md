**A complete wire harness for your python web app.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ie, handles bytes-on-the-wire to and from your Django thing or whatever)

Python has wonderful web technologies and solutions for exposing web applications and network resources, such as mod_wsgi, uWSGI and Gunicorn.

Hendrix seeks to add to this discussion by focusing on:

* Being async-native and providing "web culture" APIs for doing "async stuff."
* Being more feature-rich instead of more lightweight
* Adopting an agnosticism about the status of WSGI and web applications as network services

## History
It started as a fork of the
[slashRoot deployment module](https://github.com/SlashRoot/WHAT/tree/44f50ee08c5d7acb74ed8a4ce928e85eb2dc714f/deployment).

The name is the result of some inane psychological formula wherein the
'twisted' version of Django Reinhardt is Jimi Hendrix.

Hendrix is currently maintained by [Reelio](reelio.com).
